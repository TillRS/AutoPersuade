# Generating Arguments for Veganism Using GPT-4

## Original Argument Collection
### Objective
The goal is to generate alternative and more convincing arguments for veganism by leveraging GPT-4. The approach involves creating concise and detailed versions of given arguments, refining the content to be more persuasive and nuanced.

### Model and Settings
- **Model Used**: GPT-4-0613
- **Temperature**: 0.9

### Methodology
1. **Input Data**:
   - A manual collection of 93 original arguments for veganism is used as input. Each argument is sourced from online resources such as animal rights advocacy websites.
   - 10 distinct arguments generated by GPT-4:
     - GPT-Argument Prompt:
     ```
     Please provide a list of 10 distinct arguments for veganism, each of them being approximately 5 sentences long. 
     Ensure that they are covering a wide range of arguments for veganism. 
     Include some numbers and statistics to make the arguments more convincing.
     ```

2. **Generating Concise Arguments**:
   - For each argument, a prompt is created asking GPT-4 to generate a concise, more convincing version of the argument, ideally between 150-180 characters long.
   - Example Prompt:
     ```
     Consider the following argument for veganism and write a condensed version of the argument that is more convincing and is approximately 150-180 characters long.
     Original Argument: [original_argument]
     ```
   - The generated concise argument is then stored as a summary.
   - For each original, manually collected argument, 3 summaries are created, and for each GPT-based argument, 2 summaries are created.

3. **Generating Detailed Arguments**:
   - A second prompt is crafted for each concise argument to generate a more detailed, elaborative version, aimed to be between 270-280 characters long.
   - Example Prompt:
     ```
     You are an advocate of veganism, providing more detailed versions of arguments for the cause to be able to use them in a survey to find the most convincing arguments.
     Consider the following argument for veganism and write a more elaborate version of the argument that is more convincing and is 270-280 characters long.
     Make sure to actually give the argument for veganism rather than describing it indirectly. 

     Ensure the answer is in the format: Detailed argument: ...

     Original argument: [summary]
     ```
   - An alternative version of this prompt asks for `... a more elaborate version of the argument that is less convincing and is 270-280 characters long...`
   - Multiple versions of the detailed argument are generated from each summary:
     - Two summaries of each manually collected argument are used to generate 5 new, more convincing arguments each.
     - Two summaries of each GPT-based argument are used to generate 5 new, more convincing arguments each.
     - One summary of each manually collected argument is used to generate 3 new, less convincing arguments each.
   - This leads to a total of $93 \times 2 \times 5 + 10 \times 2 \times 5 + 93 \times 1 \times 3 = 1309$ arguments in our collection.

4. **Processing the Output**:
   - After generating the new arguments, some formatting adjustments are made to ensure consistency.

5. **Storing and Saving Results**:
   - The original arguments, their concise summaries, and the detailed versions are stored in a `Original_Argument_Collection.xslx` and exported to an Excel file for further analysis.
   - The DataFrame columns include:
     - `Original`: The original argument from the input data.
     - `Summary`: The condensed version of the argument.
     - `New_Argument`: The final refined version of the detailed argument.
     - `New_Argument_Raw`: The raw output before formatting.

### Example Workflow
1. **Original Argument**: 
   "Battery farms consist of huge, windowless sheds housing thousands of hens who are crammed four or five at a time into small wire cages stacked on top of each other in rows. Each hen may have as little as 430 cm² of space: too small to spread even one wing. Battery farms exist across the world, and the majority of egg-laying hens in the US are battery, despite bans in some states. In the EU, barren battery cages are banned in favour of ‘enriched’ cages, though these only provide 600 cm² of usable space: less than an A4 size of paper. Meanwhile, some farms have been known to break the ban and still use the older, smaller cages."

2. **Concise Argument**: 
   - Prompt Output: "Imagine living your life inside a space smaller than an A4 paper, unable to stretch. That's the reality for the majority of egg-laying hens. Choose veganism."

3. **Detailed Argument**: 
   - Prompt Output: "Picture a life within confines smaller than a sheet of A4 paper, never being able to stretch or move freely. This suffocating reality is the grim daily life for countless egg-laying hens. Embrace veganism to end this tragic treatment of sentient beings."

## Argument Collection for Validation Studies 1 & 2
### Objective

The goal was to generate a new set of persuasive arguments for veganism using synthesis and modification techniques. This was done by leveraging the 45 best-performing arguments from our previously established collection of 1309 arguments, selected based on their Bradley-Terry scores from the initial survey experiment.

### Methodology
 Selection of Proto-Arguments:
    - Out of the 45 top-performing arguments, 20 were identified as proto-arguments based on their latent topic loadings and persuasiveness scores.
Generation Approaches:
    - Two primary approaches were used to create new arguments: Synthesis and Stronger Emphasis.

1. **Synthesis Arguments:**

    Approach: GPT-4 was prompted to combine pairs of proto-arguments to generate new synthesis arguments.
    Number of Arguments: Each pair of proto-arguments (20 × 19 pairs) was used to generate 2 distinct synthesis arguments, resulting in a total of 760 synthesis arguments.
    Prompt Used:
    
    ```
    Background Information
    ----------------------
    We fit a topic model on a collection of arguments for veganism trying to find the most persuasive arguments.
    This yielded the following topics:
    {topic_labels}

    Below are two exemplar arguments that had high topic loading for a given topic in our corpus and were rated as very persuasive.

    Exemplar 1
    ----------
    Topic Label: {exemplar_01_label}
    Content: {exemplar_01_text}
    Topic Loadings: {exemplar_01_topics}

    Exemplar 2
    ----------
    Topic Label: {exemplar_02_label}
    Content: {exemplar_02_text}
    Topic Loadings: {exemplar_02_topics}

    Task
    ----
    Write a new argument that combines Exemplar 1 and Exemplar 2 so that the resulting argument has high scores for {exemplar_01_label} and {exemplar_02_label}.

    Rules
    -----
    - The new text should be 280 characters or less.
    - The new text should not introduce elements not in Exemplar 1 or 2.
    ```

2. **Stronger Emphasis Arguments:**

    Approach: Each proto-argument was rewritten to emphasize its primary latent topic more strongly.
    Number of Arguments: For each proto-argument, three new versions were generated, resulting in 60 stronger emphasis arguments (20 proto-arguments × 3).
    Prompt Used:
    ```
    Background Information
    ----------------------
    We fit a topic model on a collection of arguments for veganism trying to find the most persuasive arguments.
    This yielded the following topics:
    {topic_labels}

    Below is one exemplar document that had high topic loading for a given topic in our corpus and was rated as very persuasive.

    Exemplar 1
    ----------
    Topic Label: {exemplar_01_label}
    Content: {exemplar_01_text}
    Topic Loadings: {exemplar_01_topics}

    Task
    ----
    Change Exemplar 1 so that the resulting argument has an even higher score for {exemplar_01_label}.

    Rules
    -----
    - The new text should be 280 characters or less.
    - Only return the changed, new argument.
    ```

    Filtering and Selection:
        - Generated arguments were filtered through rejection sampling to ensure they had the desired topic loadings and predicted persuasiveness scores higher than their respective proto-arguments.
        - From these filtered arguments, the top 30 distinct synthesis arguments and the top 15 distinct stronger emphasis arguments were selected based on their predicted persuasiveness scores.

3. **GPT-Best Arguments:**
    - An additional set of 10 arguments was generated by prompting GPT-4 to produce its “most persuasive” pro-veganism arguments.
    Prompt Used:

    ```
    Background Information
    ----------------------
    We are collecting arguments pro veganism.

    Task
    ----
    Write the most convincing argument for veganism for an online survey. 

    Rules
    -----
    - The new text should be 280 characters or less.
    ```

4. **Final Argument Set:**
    The final collection comprised 100 arguments and is stored in `Validation_Study1_Arguments.xlsx`:
    - 45 best-performing original arguments (Original).
    - 30 synthesis arguments (Argument Synthesis).
    - 15 stronger emphasis arguments (Stronger Emphasis).
    - 10 best GPT-generated arguments (GPT-best).

## Argument Collection for Validation Study 3

### Objective

The objective of this validation study was to evaluate the average effects of modifying the presence of a specific topic within a set of veganism arguments. The focus was on altering the presence of Topic (2): "Inefficient Use of Resources" to understand the Average Marginal Component Effect (AMCE) in the population of arguments.

### Methodology

1. **Selection of Arguments:**
   - The study intervened on arguments from the original set of 1309, specifically targeting Topic (2): "Inefficient Use of Resources."
   - **High Topic (2) Loading Group**: 100 arguments were randomly selected from the original set that had a high loading for Topic (2) (greater than 2.0, corresponding to the 87th percentile).
   - **Low Topic (2) Loading Group**: 200 arguments were selected with a low loading for Topic (2) (less than 2.0).

2. **Modification of Topic Presence:**
   - Two different prompts were used to modify the presence of Topic (2) in the selected arguments:
     - **Increase Presence**: For the 200 arguments with low Topic (2) loading, GPT-4 was prompted to rewrite them to increase the presence of Topic (2).
     - **Decrease Presence**: For the 100 arguments with high Topic (2) loading, GPT-4 was prompted to rewrite them to decrease the presence of Topic (2).

3. **Prompts Used:**
   - **Stronger Emphasis Prompt (Increase Topic Presence):**
     ```
     Background Information
     ----------------------
     We conducted a topic modeling analysis on a set of arguments advocating for veganism to identify the most compelling ones.
     The analysis produced the following topics:

     {topic_labels}

     Below is one sample document along with its respective topic loadings.

     Exemplar 1
     ----------
     Content: {exemplar_01_text}
     Topic Loadings: {exemplar_01_topics}

     Task
     ----
     Change Exemplar 1 so that the resulting argument has a higher score for {exemplar_01_label}.
     However, keep as much as possible of the original Exemplar 1 unchanged to keep the other topic loadings the same.

     Rules
     -----
     - The new text should be 280 characters or less.
     - Only return the changed, new argument.
     ```

   - **Less Emphasis Prompt (Decrease Topic Presence):**
     ```

     Rules
     -----
     - The new text should be 280 characters or less.
     - Only return the changed, new argument.
     ```

4. **Filtering and Selection of Modified Arguments:**
   - From the rewritten arguments, a selection process was undertaken:
     - **Increased Presence**: 80 arguments were curated from the modified set with increased Topic (2) presence.
     - **Decreased Presence**: 20 arguments were curated from the modified set with decreased Topic (2) presence.
   - These 100 modified arguments were combined with the original 100 high Topic (2) loading arguments, forming a set of 200 arguments used for the validation study.

5. **Final Argument Set:**
   - The final collection for Validation Study 3 is stored in `Validation_Study3_Arguments.xlsx`:
     - 100 original arguments with high Topic (2) loading.
     - 80 modified arguments with increased Topic (2) presence.
     - 20 modified arguments with decreased Topic (2) presence.
